# Probability
Probability is simply how likely something is to happen.
For example, the probability of flipping a coin and it being heads is ½, because there is 1 way of getting a head and the total number of possible outcomes is 2 (a head or tail). We write P(heads) = ½ .

## Mutually exclusive events
Mutually exclusive events are those events that do not occur at the same time. For example, when a coin is tossed then the result will be either head or tail, but we cannot get both the results.

If A and B are mutually exclusive events then its probability is given by P(A Or B) or P (A U B).
P (A Or B) = P(A) + P(B)
P (A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)

## Problem
What is the probability of a die showing a number 1 or number 3?

P(3 or 1) = P(3) + P(1)
P(3 or 1) = (1/6) + (1/6) = 2/6
P(3 or 1) = 1/3.
