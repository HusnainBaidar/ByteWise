## Hello, World!

For printing simple or for showing an output via python a programmer is required to write print then ( " then you enter your text in here " )
Example:
``` python
print("Hello, World!")
```
## Variables and Types
Python supports two types of numbers
1) Integers ( mostly known as int).
2) Floating point.

## Strings
Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quote. You " Your Text here" Everything which is inside the single or double quote is considered a string.
You can apply mathematical operators like + and x on strings.

## Lists
Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner.

**append()**	Adds an element at the end of the list

**clear()**	Removes all the elements from the list

**copy()**	Returns a copy of the list

**count()** Returns the number of elements with the specified value

**extend()**	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list

**index()** Returns the index of the first element with the specified value

**insert()**	Adds an element at the specified position

**pop()**	Removes the element at the specified position

**remove()**	Removes the first item with the specified value

**reverse()**	Reverses the order of the list

**sort()**	Sorts the list.
