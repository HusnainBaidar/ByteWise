## What is Natural Language Processing(NLP)?

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with analyzing, understanding, and generating the languages that humans use naturally in order to interface with computers in both written and spoken contexts using natural human languages instead of computer languages.

## Applications of NLP

* Machine translation(Google Translate)
* Natural language generation
* Web Search
* Spam filters
* Sentiment Analysis
* Chatbots

## What is natural language understanding (NLU)?

Natural language understanding is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses computer software to understand input in the form of sentences using text or speech.

NLU enables human-computer interaction. It is the comprehension of human language such as English, Spanish and French, for example, that allows computers to understand commands without the formalized syntax of computer languages. NLU also enables computers to communicate back to humans in their own languages.

## What Does Natural Language Generation (NLG) Mean?
Natural language generation (NLG) is the sub-category of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze a collection of discrete digital inputs and summarize them by producing text that appears to be written by a human.

NLG algorithms rely on computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) to autonomously transform structured data into human-readable text. The goal of NLG is to programmatically produce narratives that are capable of passing a Turing test.
